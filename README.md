# MPPT Algorithm for Design of Hybrid Solar Power System
In this project, we will mainly focus on Hybrid Solar Power System. It discusses the related basic concept and component development of a solar system in three steps:
1. Designing a domestic hybrid power system which is less than 10kW
2. MATLAB / Simulink dynamic simulation for optimal hybrid power system PV system component with battery integration
3. Testing the simulation and presenting it along with the simulation results
